A continuous stream of information is daily consumed by a person. It is represented in different forms under various formats. And due to the great amounts of data that surrounds us nowadays, communication efficiency became a crucial problem. Throughout the time, data representation suffered a sequence of changes, thus constantly evolving. Starting from architecture, letters on papers ending with radio, television and computers wired through Internet.

Textual format remains the most common method of transmitting information. Though not the most efficient, it is cheap in terms of storage, expressive and extensive. The problem is that people encounter problems in the process of absorbing textual data. The mnemonic techniques usually are not enough for extracting the key information from text.

Text processing on a bigger scale becomes a tedious operation for a human being. That's why people resort to computers in order to solve the problem more efficiently. Data Science, a fairly new field in computer science, tackles this problem. Actually it employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics as statistics, information theory probability models, machine learning, data mining, database, pattern recognition and many others. The problems which it solves are marketing optimization, fraud detection, trends detection even sport bets.

The problem researched in this work is concerning online media, articles published by Moldavian sources such as Timpul, Unimedia, Publika. The goal is to create a platform where users could query word frequency. Search for the trends relevant for different periods of time. Observe which sources are emphasizing specific key words, detect biases. Basically provide a visualization methods from which viable conclusions can be drawn. Why it is important to have such tool on the local market? Because there isn't one present. And second is that people running business, from various areas, could tune their approach based on results provided by platform. Journalism is another niche targeted by the platform. It is not that easy to write an article regarding events which happened in the course of an year. While it is much simpler when you can observe things like: when was a specific topic more popular and when it started to become less known. Which political entity is more discussed, in what period of time? News media is the quintessential origin of information feed. The good thing is that it can be processed and used, in terms of software, for providing essential data in an understandable manner.

The application would consist from two separate parts. First one represents the data mining platform. It have the purpose to go through media web portals and pull all the available articles. Extracts the articles content and store into a database. Run tokenization and part of speech tagger tasks in order to enrich the articles with useful metadata, used for meaningful queries and proper data visualization. The second part represents the client interaction application. It's a web platform which provides querying features and visualization options. The queries most likely will represent map reduce tasks which will run on the storage used by the first platform. The gate through which the two parts will communicate will be the database.
